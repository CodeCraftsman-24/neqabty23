# Deployment Requirements Analysis

## Application Overview
- Flask-based web application for team attendance management
- Uses SQLite database for data storage
- Includes user authentication, attendance tracking with geolocation, and reporting features

## Deployment Requirements

### Hosting Requirements
- Need a platform that supports Python web applications
- Must support Flask applications
- Should provide persistent storage for the SQLite database
- Must be accessible via public URL

### Security Requirements
- HTTPS support for secure data transmission
- Secure storage of sensitive information (passwords, location data)
- Environment variables for configuration secrets

### Database Considerations
- SQLite is suitable for low to medium traffic
- Need to ensure database file is stored in a persistent location
- Regular backups should be implemented

### Performance Requirements
- Application should handle multiple concurrent users
- Page load times should be optimized
- Static assets should be served efficiently

### Maintenance Requirements
- Easy deployment of updates
- Monitoring of application health
- Backup and restore procedures

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Site Deployment
- Convert Flask app to a static site with API endpoints
- Deploy frontend as static site
- Deploy backend as serverless functions

### Option 2: Next.js Conversion
- Rewrite application using Next.js framework
- Leverage server-side rendering capabilities
- Use built-in API routes for backend functionality

## Recommended Approach
Based on the available deployment tools and the nature of the application, the recommended approach is:

1. Convert the application to a Next.js application
2. Use the built-in deployment capabilities
3. Implement proper database migration and storage
4. Set up HTTPS and security measures
5. Configure monitoring and maintenance procedures

This approach will provide a permanent, scalable deployment with good performance and security characteristics.
